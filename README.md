# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-Smartphone-data

The "Human-Activity-Recognition-using-Smartphone-data" GitHub repository hosts a project dedicated to developing machine learning models for recognizing human activities based on smartphone sensor data. This project is motivated by the growing interest in wearable technology and the potential applications in health monitoring, fitness tracking, and context-aware computing.

## Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to build robust and accurate classifiers capable of automatically identifying various human activities, such as walking, running, sitting, standing, and climbing stairs, using data collected from smartphone sensors. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the project aims to enable real-time activity recognition on smartphones for diverse applications.

## Key Features:

- Dataset Acquisition: Providing scripts or instructions for acquiring publicly available datasets containing smartphone sensor data annotated with human activity labels.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, filtering, and preprocessing the raw sensor data to extract meaningful features and prepare it for model training.
- Feature Engineering: Engineering informative features from accelerometer, gyroscope, and other sensor readings to capture patterns relevant to different activities.
- Model Selection: Exploring and evaluating various machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, support vector machines, and deep neural networks, for activity recognition.
- Model Training: Training selected models using the preprocessed data and optimizing their hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained models using cross-validation and testing on independent datasets to measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Deployment: Developing lightweight and efficient models suitable for deployment on smartphones, enabling real-time activity recognition on-device.
